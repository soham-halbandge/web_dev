HTML (Hyper text markup language)
---------------------------------

- helps to structure a document

There are HTML elements to structure a document
-----------------------------------------------

1. <p> -> paragraph (use to represent a paragraph)

To use HTML elements we use opening and closing tag (for most of the elements). 
We open and close the tag with < > anchor brackets.
so, <p> -> opening of paragraph tag and </p> is closing of paragraph tag.
and inside that content should be wrapped.

2. Heading elements 

<h1> <h2> .... to <h6> : creates a heading h1 being highest size and h6 being the smallest size
<h1> This is a heading </h1>

Structure of HTML 
-----------------

<!DOCTYPE html> -> this is to tell browser that we are using html 5 (version)
<html lang="en"> -> this notifies that html starts from here

<head> -> this gives information and data about the html document
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title> -> this will give the title for the title bar present in web browser
</head>

<body> -> all the actual content goes in the body tag
   
    <!-- content goes over here -->
    
</body>

</html> -> this notifies that html ends over here
