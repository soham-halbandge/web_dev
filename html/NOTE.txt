HTML (Hyper text markup language)
---------------------------------

- helps to structure a document

There are HTML elements to structure a document
-----------------------------------------------

1. <p> -> paragraph (use to represent a paragraph)

To use HTML elements we use opening and closing tag (for most of the elements). 
We open and close the tag with < > anchor brackets.
so, <p> -> opening of paragraph tag and </p> is closing of paragraph tag.
and inside that content should be wrapped.

2. Heading elements 

<h1> <h2> .... to <h6> : creates a heading h1 being highest size and h6 being the smallest size
<h1> This is a heading </h1>

3. strong <strong> -> it will display as bold text. Useful for adding emphasis (mostly useful for screen readers)

4. <b> (Bring attention to element) -> it wil display also as bold text. 

5. <em> (emphasis) -> stress emphasis relative to surrounding text. Most browser will render it as italics. 

6. <sup> -> used as a superscript for e.g. 4th here th is written on top of 4

7. <sub> -> used as a subscript for e.g. H2O here 2 is written at bottom of H 

Structure of HTML 
-----------------

<!DOCTYPE html> -> this is to tell browser that we are using html 5 (version)
<html lang="en"> -> this notifies that html starts from here

<head> -> this gives information and data about the html document
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title> -> this will give the title for the title bar present in web browser
</head>

<body> -> all the actual content goes in the body tag
   
    <!-- content goes over here -->
    
</body>

</html> -> this notifies that html ends over here

Lists in HTML
-------------

1. Unordered List <ul>
2. Ordered List <ol>

and we use <li> to provide the list items.

Block vs Inline elements  
-------------------------

block elements consumes the entire block. 
for e.g. <h1>Hello</h1><h1>World</h1>
so the word "World" will get printed on new lines since Hello's h1 tag consumed whole 1st block 

inline elements are laid out by fragmenting in stack of line of boxes
for e.g. <p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p> -> it gets printed as H2O and here subscript is an inline element
