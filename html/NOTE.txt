HTML (Hyper text markup language)
---------------------------------

- helps to structure a document

There are HTML elements to structure a document
-----------------------------------------------

1. <p> -> paragraph (use to represent a paragraph)

To use HTML elements we use opening and closing tag (for most of the elements). 
We open and close the tag with < > anchor brackets.
so, <p> -> opening of paragraph tag and </p> is closing of paragraph tag.
and inside that content should be wrapped.

2. Heading elements 

<h1> <h2> .... to <h6> : creates a heading h1 being highest size and h6 being the smallest size
<h1> This is a heading </h1>

3. strong <strong> -> it will display as bold text. Useful for adding emphasis (mostly useful for screen readers)

4. <b> (Bring attention to element) -> it wil display also as bold text. 

5. <em> (emphasis) -> stress emphasis relative to surrounding text. Most browser will render it as italics. 

6. <sup> -> used as a superscript for e.g. 4th here th is written on top of 4

7. <sub> -> used as a subscript for e.g. H2O here 2 is written at bottom of H 

Structure of HTML 
-----------------

<!DOCTYPE html> -> this is to tell browser that we are using html 5 (version)
<html lang="en"> -> this notifies that html starts from here

<head> -> this gives information and data about the html document
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title> -> this will give the title for the title bar present in web browser
</head>

<body> -> all the actual content goes in the body tag
   
    <!-- content goes over here -->
    
</body>

</html> -> this notifies that html ends over here

Lists in HTML
-------------

1. Unordered List <ul>
2. Ordered List <ol>

and we use <li> to provide the list items.

Block vs Inline elements  
-------------------------

block elements consumes the entire block. 
for e.g. <h1>Hello</h1><h1>World</h1>
so the word "World" will get printed on new lines since Hello's h1 tag consumed whole 1st block 

inline elements are laid out by fragmenting in stack of line of boxes
for e.g. <p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p> -> it gets printed as H2O and here subscript is an inline element

Links in HTML (They are inline in nature)
-------------

to create links in HTML, we use the <a> tag which is called anchor tag.
it has attribute alongside with it which controls a behaviour.
for e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Go to Reddit</a>
here a is tag and href is attribute where it will take you to given destination and "Go To Reddit" is the text 
you will see and once you click on it you will get redirected to that website.

we can link 
1. to another website 
2. to another html page 
3. to another element in the same html page
4. to default mail application for given email
5. calling a telephone number
6. by clicking on img to above 5

for (3),
<a href="#Section_further_down">Jump to the heading below</a>
<h2 id="Section_further_down">Section further down</h2>

To load an image in html
------------------------

using the <img> tag.
<img src="path_to_image.png" alt="cute image">
where src is source path to the image and alt is the alternative text to the image if image is not found 
then it will show the text present in alt attribute (alt is also useful for voice reader as well)

tables in html
--------------

we create table using <table> tag
we use <tr> to create table rows
we use <td> to create table data 
we use <th> to create table head
we use <thead>, <tbody> and <tfoot> to header, body and footer (useful for screen reader and styling)
we use <caption> to give title to the table

we use colspan as an property/attribute -> this occupies space across multiple columns of the table 
we use rowspan as an property/attribute -> this occupies space across multiple rows of the table 

forms in html
--------------

<input type="text"> is for text field

to use forms
<form action="/signup" method="get"> 
    <!-- content goes here -->
</form>

action -> where the form data is sent 
method -> what http 'verb' is used

we use <button> to create button
we can also use <input type="submit"> to create button 

labels for form
---------------
<label for="username">Enter your username</label>
<input type="text" id="username">

to make field mandatory in form (use `required` as attribute)

Textareas in forms
------------------

<textarea rows="1" cols="5"> </textarea>
